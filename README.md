## Task 2: Coins

Some cash register systems use change machines that automatically dispense coins.  In this task, you will investigate the problem solving and programming behind such machinery. You always want to use the fewest coins possible. You should use integer mathematics to solve this problem.

In the `main.py` file, write a program that prompts the user for the number of cents. Using *conditional statements* calculate the number of each type of coin.

*Ex. * 

```
Enter the amount of cents: 35

Quarters:	1
Dimes:	1
Nickels:	0
Pennys:	0
   
Enter the amount of cents: 41
Quarters:	1
Dimes:	1
Nickels:	1
Pennys: 1	
```
